The Nutch 1.X releases are cut from the Nutch `master` branch code base.

*Nutch 2.X is a different code base and uses different data structures. For more information on the 2.X branch, we urge users to consult the [Nutch 2 wiki documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/NUTCH/Archive+and+Legacy#ArchiveandLegacy-Nutch2.x). Note that Nutch 2.X has been retired in October 2019 and Nutch 2.4 is the last release of the Nutch 2.x line.*
